# TELOS

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document captures the TELOS method of articulating personal context so that Herbert, and AI, can better understand him and help him improve.

**Conceptual path:** Problems -> Mission -> (Narratives) -> Goals -> Challenges -> Strategies -> Projects -> Journal

Any project can be mapped back up to the problem(s) it solves. This gives transparency and explainability — no being busy for days/months/years without remembering why.

**See also:** PROBLEMS.md, MISSION.md, NARRATIVES.md, GOALS.md, CHALLENGES.md, PROJECTS.md, WISDOM.md, TRAUMAS.md, BOOKS.md, MOVIES.md, PREDICTIONS.md, WRONG.md, FRAMES.md, MODELS.md, STRATEGIES.md, LEARNED.md, updates.md
