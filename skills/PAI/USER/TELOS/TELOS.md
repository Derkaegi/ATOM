# TELOS

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document captures the TELOS method of articulating personal context so that Herbert, and AI, can better understand him and help him improve.

**Conceptual path:** Problems -> Mission -> (Narratives) -> Goals -> Challenges -> Strategies -> Projects -> Journal

Any project can be mapped back up to the problem(s) it solves. This gives transparency and explainability — no being busy for days/months/years without remembering why.

---

## HISTORY

- Grew up in Germany, studied and taught philosophy.
- Transitioned into iGaming, fantasy sports, and PR — built communities and content strategies.
- Explored AI, education, and content strategy as solopreneur (2023-2025).
- January 2026: Secured B2B technical writing contract at HP Barcelona via Infogain — provides stable income while maintaining PokerStories partnership.

---

## PROBLEMS

- **P1:** Too many interests and skills -> distraction and lack of follow-through on business ideas.
- **P2:** Administrative tasks drain energy and kill consistency.
- **P3:** ~~Need for stable income while maintaining identity and impact.~~ **RESOLVED** — HP/Infogain contract provides stable income (Jan 2026 - Dec 2026).
- **P4:** Balancing full-time technical writing work with PokerStories partnership commitments.
- **P5:** Academic potential underutilized — philosophy PhD + 19 years experience gathering dust while postdoc opportunities exist (now less urgent with stable income).

---

## MISSION

- **M1:** Build sustainable career: HP/Infogain technical writing (PRIMARY income) + PokerStories business (SECONDARY, evenings/weekends) + opportunistic academic positioning and writing.
- **M2:** Guide others through authentic, thoughtful work — not self-promotion or corporate positioning.
- **M3:** Leverage stable income from HP contract (2026) to sustain PokerStories momentum while preserving space for academic writing and creative inquiry (Griffl, weird ideas).

---

## NARRATIVES

- **N1:** Herbert with philosophy PhD training who built a poker career, explored AI questions, now returning to academia with enriched practical perspective — rigorous analysis mixed with willingness to chase weird ideas. Formal training provides the analytical backbone, real-world experience (poker, entrepreneurship) keeps it grounded, returning to research with interdisciplinary insights academia rarely sees.
- **N2:** Authority through unconventional path — academic rigor + practical success + creative exploration. Not afraid to look silly if the idea is interesting. Work quality matters more than polished positioning. Some projects succeed (PokerStories), some are just fun (weird philosophical experiments).
- **N3:** Work speaks through honesty, depth, and occasional delightful weirdness. Philosophy training shows in how I think, not what I call myself. Poker expertise proves through insider access and results. AI/creative work earns respect through substance, tolerates experimental tangents.

## GOALS

### Short-Term (Q1-Q2 2026)

- **G1:** Successfully onboard at HP Barcelona/Infogain (started Jan 19, 2026) — PRIMARY focus during working hours. Target: autonomous DITA contributor within 3 months.
- **G2:** Launch PokerStories book (March 2026 target).
- ~~**G3:** Transition Griffl to sustainable personal blog (philosophical essays, no pressure).~~
- ~~**G8:** Bridge income via unemployment benefits~~ — **REPLACED** by HP/Infogain contract providing stable income through Dec 2026.
- **G9:** Coordinate with Wladimir on adjusted PokerStories timeline given new employment.

### Long-Term (3-5 years)

- **G4:** Build PokerStories into sustainable income stream alongside employment (target: 40K+ EUR/year per partner when capacity allows).
- **G5:** Develop authentic philosophical voice in AI discourse (essays, talks when invited).
- **G6:** Maintain financial independence while preserving intellectual freedom for creative projects.
- **G7:** Evaluate postdoc opportunities opportunistically.

---

## CHALLENGES

- **C1:** ~~Submit 15+ postdoc applications~~ — **DEPRIORITIZED** (stable income secured via HP contract).
- **C2:** Maintain consistency on PokerStories book writing and podcast production **around full-time work schedule**.
- **C3:** Balance HP/Infogain technical writing (PRIMARY, 40 working hours/week, 3 times presencial in Sant Cugat, weekends free, commute 1h each way, breaks included in working time).
- **C4:** Keep SetPieceTakers automated with minimal weekly maintenance.
- **C5:** Communicate effectively with Wladimir about reduced PokerStories availability during HP contract.
- **C6:** Manage energy levels balancing day job with creative side projects.
- **C7:** Commute logistics — getting to HP Sant Cugat 3+ days per week (hybrid arrangement, commuting mostly with FerroCarril, 1h each way).
- **C8:** DITA/XML learning curve — new technical stack requires focused skill development in first 3 months.

  - Important: Non-compete with Infogain clients, no AI tools without approval.
  - Identity Alignment: 3/5 (Income necessity). **This is the day job that provides financial stability.**

- **P1: PokerStories** — SECONDARY (30%)
  - Book-first content business, 50/50 partnership with Wladimir Taschner (insyder19).
  - Book launch March 2026 target, podcast reduced to 4-6 episodes/month during HP onboarding.
  - Patreon community. Financial targets adjusted for part-time capacity.
  - Identity Alignment: 5/5 (Perfect Fit). **Evenings and weekends focus. Coordinate reduced commitment with Wladimir.**

- **P2: Postdoc Applications & Academic Positioning** — Opportunistic (5%)
  - ~~IMMEDIATE applications~~ **DEPRIORITIZED** — stable income now secured via HP contract.
  - Keep materials updated, apply opportunistically if excellent fit appears. No pressure timeline.
  - Identity Alignment: 5/5 (Perfect Fit). Can revisit aggressively when HP contract ends (Dec 2026) or if circumstances change.

- **P3: Griffl.org** — Background (2%)
  - Deprioritized personal blog. Philosophical inquiry exploring AI questions.
  - Essay-style, personal voice, no rigid schedule. Low pressure, creative outlet.

- **P4: SetPieceTakers.com** — Background (2%)
  - Automated football analytics. Weekly maintenance check (Tuesdays only). Report exceptions only.

- **P5: AI Tutoring** (Mindrift, e2F) — **PAUSED**
  - No longer needed for income bridge. HP contract provides stable income.
  - Revisit if HP hours are significantly below full-time.

- **P6: Freelance Writer** (poker-focused) — **PAUSED**
  - Focus energy on PokerStories instead of scattered freelance.

- **P7: University Teaching** (Philosophy & Sociology for Engineers) — Scheduled
  - Part of academic profile. May need to decline if conflicts with HP schedule.

**Non-Negotiable:** HP contract is the PRIMARY income source (Jan-Dec 2026). PokerStories continues as meaningful SECONDARY pursuit. Personal identity alignment remains important but financial stability secured via HP contract takes precedence during contract period.

## DRAFT SECTIONS (Needs Revision)

> The following sections were carried over from a previous version and are flagged as **not yet representative**. Herbert should revise these when ready.

### Things I've Been Wrong About

*(To be filled in)*

### Ideas

- When you are good at something, you will prevail. Quality often loses.
- Bad luck has only short term influence, but it can have lifechanging impact.

### Predictions

*(To be filled in)*

### Best Movies

*(To be filled in)*

### Best Books

- Platon, Politeia
- Aristoteles, Nikomachische Ethik
- Tolstoy, Krieg und Frieden

### Best Website Styles

- https://obsidian.md/
- https://www.elementsofai.com/
- https://www.smashingmagazine.com/

### Wisdom

- The magic you're looking for is in the work you're avoiding.
- In practice, weak people behave very similarly to evil people. Don't tie yourself to either.
- When I am feeling low mood or low energy, 95% of the time it's because I have not 1) gotten up early, 2) gotten outside, 3) worked out, 4) gone for a walk, or done anything else physical in the last 2 days. Just go do that, and you'll instantly feel better.
