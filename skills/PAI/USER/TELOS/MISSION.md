# MISSION

- **M1:** Build sustainable career: HP/Infogain technical writing (PRIMARY income) + PokerStories business (SECONDARY, evenings/weekends) + opportunistic academic positioning and writing.
- **M2:** Guide others through authentic, thoughtful work — not self-promotion or corporate positioning.
- **M3:** Leverage stable income from HP contract (2026) to sustain PokerStories momentum while preserving space for academic writing and creative inquiry (Griffl, weird ideas).
