# WISDOM & IDEAS

## Ideas

- When you are good at something, you will prevail. Quality often loses.
- Bad luck has only short term influence, but it can have lifechanging impact.

## Wisdom

- The magic you're looking for is in the work you're avoiding.
- In practice, weak people behave very similarly to evil people. Don't tie yourself to either.
- When I am feeling low mood or low energy, 95% of the time it's because I have not 1) gotten up early, 2) gotten outside, 3) worked out, 4) gone for a walk, or done anything else physical in the last 2 days. Just go do that, and you'll instantly feel better.
