# PROBLEMS

- **P1:** Too many interests and skills -> distraction and lack of follow-through on business ideas.
- **P2:** Administrative tasks drain energy and kill consistency.
- **P3:** ~~Need for stable income while maintaining identity and impact.~~ **RESOLVED** — HP/Infogain contract provides stable income (Jan 2026 - Dec 2026).
- **P4:** Balancing full-time technical writing work with PokerStories partnership commitments.
- **P5:** Academic potential underutilized — philosophy PhD + 19 years experience gathering dust while postdoc opportunities exist (now less urgent with stable income).
