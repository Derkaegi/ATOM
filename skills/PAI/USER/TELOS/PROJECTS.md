  - Identity Alignment: 3/5 (Income necessity). **This is the day job that provides financial stability.**

- **P1: PokerStories** — SECONDARY (30%)
  - Book-first content business, 50/50 partnership with Wladimir Taschner (insyder19).
  - Book launch March 2026 target, podcast reduced to 4-6 episodes/month during HP onboarding.
  - Patreon community. Financial targets adjusted for part-time capacity.
  - Identity Alignment: 5/5 (Perfect Fit). **Evenings and weekends focus. Coordinate reduced commitment with Wladimir.**

- **P2: Postdoc Applications & Academic Positioning** — Opportunistic (5%)
  - ~~IMMEDIATE applications~~ **DEPRIORITIZED** — stable income now secured via HP contract.
  - Keep materials updated, apply opportunistically if excellent fit appears. No pressure timeline.

- **P5: AI Tutoring** (Mindrift, e2F) — **PAUSED**
  - No longer needed for income bridge. HP contract provides stable income.

- **P6: Freelance Writer** (poker-focused) — **PAUSED**
  - Focus energy on PokerStories instead of scattered freelance.

- **P7: University Teaching** (Philosophy & Sociology for Engineers) — Scheduled
  - Part of academic profile. May need to decline if conflicts with HP schedule.

**Non-Negotiable:** HP contract is the PRIMARY income source (Jan-Dec 2026). PokerStories continues as meaningful SECONDARY pursuit. Personal identity alignment remains important but financial stability secured via HP contract takes precedence during contract period.
