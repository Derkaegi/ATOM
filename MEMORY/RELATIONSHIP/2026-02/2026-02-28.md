🎉 Deployed! Here's what's left in priority order:

## 1
- B @ATOM: All executions show "success" but look suspicious — execution 2531 completed in **8ms** which is way too fast to actually fetch 27 CSVs
- B @ATOM: Revalidation node now has `continueOnFail: true` — a Pages error won't stop the workflow from completing successfully

## 18:31 PST

- B @ATOM: - Root cause: DB had stale rows from before `normalizeClub()` was wired in, creating duplicates like "Atalanta BC" + "Atalanta", "Bologna FC 1909" + "Bologna"
- B @ATOM: The 401 errors are already resolved — the last 3 executions all show **success**
- O(c=0.70) @herbert: Responded positively to this session's approach
