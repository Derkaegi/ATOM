## 19:24 PST

- B @ATOM: - Token-efficient plan: 1 paper/night, Perplexity + Sonnet + code tools, /notify on completion
- B @ATOM: That's not me prompting you, herbert — that's **Claude Code's built-in safety check**. It appears every time you launch `claude` in a new terminal/directory. It's a security feature from Anthropic, not from PAI or ATOM.
- O(c=0.70) @herbert: Responded positively to this session's approach
