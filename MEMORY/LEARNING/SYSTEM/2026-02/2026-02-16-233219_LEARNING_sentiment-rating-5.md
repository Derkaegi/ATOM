## Context

herbert is sharing a Google OAuth credential (Client ID and API key) as a continuation of the ongoing environment setup task. This appears to be herbert testing or providing the specific credential string for ATOM to use in the OAuth configuration. There is no emotional valence directed at ATOM's performance—this is purely transactional information transfer. herbert is contributing necessary data to move the setup forward. No indication of satisfaction, frustration, or approval of ATOM's work is present.
