# Implicit Low Rating Captured: 5/10

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Rating:** 5/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Feedback:** Technical resource sharing, no emotional indicator

## Context

Herbert interrupted the previous technical conversation (which involved examining skill installations and configurations) by sharing a GitHub repository link. The message contains no emotional language, complaint, praise, or reaction to ATOM's work. It's a simple, neutral information-sharing action with 'here!' as a casual connector. This doesn't indicate satisfaction or dissatisfaction with ATOM—it's purely transactional. No rating warranted.
