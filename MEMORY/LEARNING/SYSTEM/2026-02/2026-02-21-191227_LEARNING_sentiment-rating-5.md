## Context

herbert is issuing a simple directive to proceed with setting up boards on the newly deployed pokerstories application (boards.pokerstories.wtf). This follows immediately after ATOM successfully deployed the domain and confirmed it's live and working. There are no emotional indicators—no frustration, satisfaction, or sarcasm. This is a continuation of a workflow where herbert is delegating the next step of implementation. No sentiment toward ATOM's performance is expressed; it's a neutral command to proceed with the next task.
