# Implicit Low Rating Captured: 5/10

**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Rating:** 5/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Feedback:** Technical task request, no emotional content

## Context

herbert issued a task instruction: 'gdrive-map and plan to organize folders.' The system reported 'Unknown skill: gdrive,' indicating a missing or unrecognized tool. This is a straightforward technical request without emotional language, evaluation, or sentiment directed at ATOM's work. There are no indicators of frustration, satisfaction, or any emotional state. The message appears to be either a command, a feature request, or an instruction requiring clarification. Since there is no feedback on ATOM's previous performance and no emotional indicators present, no sentiment rating is appropriate. This is a neutral, technical exchange.
