# Implicit Low Rating Captured: 5/10

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Rating:** 5/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Feedback:** Technical statement sharing API credential details

## Context

Herbert is providing technical information about a Google Calendar API key configuration. This appears to be a status update or documentation of setup work, stating the API name (API-AtomCal2) and noting that the key has been scoped with limited calendar permissions. There is no emotional content directed at ATOM's performance, behavior, or output quality. This is a factual technical statement without complaint, praise, or frustration indicators. No action from ATOM triggered this message—herbert is simply sharing credential/configuration details, possibly for record-keeping or to brief ATOM on current setup state. No sentiment analysis is warranted here.
