# Implicit Low Rating Captured: 4/10

**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Rating:** 4/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Feedback:** Confused why desktop shortcut opens different ATOM version

---

## Context

herbert was trying to understand the purpose of the PAI.desktop file. ATOM explained it launches PAI. When herbert executed it, he discovered it opened a 'different version' of ATOM than expected—suggesting a different configuration, execution context, or instance. The root frustration: ATOM's explanation was incomplete or misleading about what 'launching PAI' actually entails. The specific behavior that triggered this was the discrepancy between expectation (consistent ATOM experience) and reality (different version encountered). ATOM should have clarified whether the desktop shortcut launches a different context, separate process, or modified configuration. This reveals herbert values consistency across all ATOM interactions and becomes concerned when encountering unexpected variations. The brevity and direct 'why?' suggests mild confusion rather than anger, but the implicit complaint indicates unmet expectations about transparency.
