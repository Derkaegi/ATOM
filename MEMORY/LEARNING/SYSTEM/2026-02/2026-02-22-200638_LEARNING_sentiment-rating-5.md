# Implicit Low Rating Captured: 5/10

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Rating:** 5/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Feedback:** Sharing Hostinger panel option for SSH reset

---

## Context

herbert provided text from the Hostinger control panel showing an SSH configuration reset option. This is informational content—herbert is likely exploring the panel's built-in reset feature as a potential solution to the SSH authentication issues (disabled PasswordAuthentication, corrupted key file). No emotional reaction to ATOM's work is present here. This is collaborative troubleshooting where herbert is reporting available options rather than responding to ATOM's assistance.
